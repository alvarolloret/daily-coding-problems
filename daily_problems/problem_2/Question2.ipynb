For each number, it calculates its complement (the number needed to reach k) and checks if that complement is already in the `seen` set. If it is, it means we've found two numbers that add up to k, so it returns `True`. If no pair is found after iterating through the entire list, it returns `False`.\n","\n","This solution operates in one pass through the list, as it only requires a single iteration to check for pairs that add up to k."],"metadata":{"id":"t0REnabtOLV_"}}]}
